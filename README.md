# Musiverse Frontend

Welcome to the Musiverse Frontend repository! This project serves as the frontend interface for our online music player, offering a range of features designed to enhance the music listening experience. Below is an overview of the project and its key features:

## Overview

Our online music player provides users with the ability to upload their own music, contributing their personal collections to the platform. Once uploaded, users can select and play songs from the music library, enabling them to enjoy their favorite tracks. The platform also offers control over playback, allowing users to pause songs at any time.

One standout feature is the ability to create custom playlists. Users can curate their music collections by selecting songs and organizing them into playlists. Additionally, users can add songs to these playlists, personalizing their music collections over time. The Playlist View provides an organized and accessible way for users to manage and enjoy their playlists.
